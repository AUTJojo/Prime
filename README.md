Code HW - 5ahw HTL Innsbruck, Austria - Prime Numbers

## How does it work?
You can simply set a number and you'll get all Primes from 2 to that set value as a return. (ArrayList)
It is not possible to set the value to anything besides an Integer. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)

#### Examaple:

```
prime(int n) {
  ...
}

ArrayList<Integer> list = prime(20);

//Prime Numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```
